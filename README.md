My name is Everett Barney. I currently live in Orlando, FL but I am originally from St. Petersburg, FL. I have worked in Finance for the past 6 years in sales, service, and operational roles. I made the decision to enroll in the University of Miami Fintech Bootcamp course because I have a growing interest in being apart of the creation of new products and operations within a large growing firm. By the end of this course, I hope to be able obtain the skillset to manage projects and products to help drive new technologies for my current firm.
